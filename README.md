# System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
I was tasked with designing an information system for DriverPass, a driver's-ed company. DriverPass wanted a system to handle. The system was to handle DriverPass' in-person driving reservations, to hold information on customers, and to provide a UI for customers to interact with the system.
# What did you do particularly well?
In the process of creating the system, I created models which described in accurate detail the requirements, assumptions, constraints, and behaviors of the system. These models are crucial for developers when designing the system, so I made sure to put detail into them.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to add more information regarding constraints and assumptions about the system. This is vital information, as it defines general traits of the system, such as how much space it will take, how responsive it must be, etc.
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Satisfying the user's needs is the end goal of software development. Software is useful because it allows someone to use it to perform a task. Therefore, I took great care in staying true to the user's requests. By the end of the course, I had memorized the system requirements quite well.
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Software must be designed with the user in mind. The process first involves gathering requirements from the user, and then creating models and thinking about the logic of the system before implementing it. However, much of this work was solo work done by myself. In the future, I would like to collaborate and get feedback on my analysis and designs. I believe collbaoration is key, and that having other intelligent system engineers and designers to work with would create even better system designs.
